More details: If the parameter PATH_ID_OBJ is nonzero it identifies a path for the object. If the parameter OPT_SPEED_OBJ is 1 or 2, then station is also installed as an ODE state variable whose derivative is V_Obj. In this case, V_Obj for each object can be imported or set with VS Commands such as EQ_OUT. Otherwise, V_Obj is calculated from changes in global X and Y coordinates.
