#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This is one of seven roads used to generate animator graphics to show a road network.
#
#The same road ID = 999 is used for all seven of the roads. The surface shape files from all seven go to VS Visualizer, but only the last one loaded is used by the math model.
#
#On the other hand, each road has a distinct reference path with its own ID. The reference paths are used to generate the surface shapes, and are also used in the math model  by the closed-loop steering controller.
