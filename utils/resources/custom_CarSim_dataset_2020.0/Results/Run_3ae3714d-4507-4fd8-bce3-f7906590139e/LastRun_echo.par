! WIND_HEADING: Wind heading (yaw) relative to global X. When vehicle yaw is zero,
! then 0 deg -> tailwind, 90 deg -> from right, 180 deg -> headwind. Heading can be a
! nonlinear CARPET function of station and time or a function of time (CONSTANT,
! COEFFICIENT, or TABLE) combined with a function WIND_HEADING_S of station
! (CONSTANT, COEFFICIENT, or TABLE). Alternatively, a custom equation can be defined

! WIND_HEADING_OFFSET. Time used in the calculation can be adjusted with
! TSCALE_WIND_HD and TSTART_WIND_HD. Station used in the calculation can be adjusted
! with SSCALE_WIND_HD and SSTART_WIND_HD.

! Z_PROFILE: "Wandering profile" (roughness input). Elevation increment is a

! SSTART_Z_PROFILE. The derivative of this function is used internally. This

! when reading data.
